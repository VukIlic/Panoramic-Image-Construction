# PanoramicImageConstruction
The main goal of this project is to create a panoramic image from a set of pictures taken with a rotating camera from a single viewpoint.

The project is provided in two files: panoramic_image.cpp and panoramic_utils.h.

In the main() function in panoramic_image.cpp file we first choose the folder from which we want to import the images. Then we define an angle value (in degrees) which is half of the FoV of the camera used to take the photos.

The output of the project is generated panoramic image.

A full explanation of how the algorithm works can be found in the file Panoramic_image.pdf.

One example of panoramic image created from a set of pictures is shown in the following figure:
