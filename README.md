# PanoramicImageConstruction
Create a panoramic image from a set of pictures taken with a rotating camera from a single viewpoint.
The project is provided in two files: “panoramic_image.cpp” and “panoramic_utils.h”.
In the main() function  in panoramic_image.cpp file we first choose the folder from which we want to import images. Then we define an angle value (in degrees) which is half of the FoV of the camera used to take the photos.
